# Description: Program to calculate the factorial for given 
# non-zero, non-negative integer input (output = input!) with system calls 
# and subroutine that utilizes the stack.
#
# Functions:
#  - fact_func: Performs factorial for input a0 (a0!) and returns result to a0
#  - mul_func:  Performs a multiple for input a0, a1 (a0 * a1) and returns result to a0
